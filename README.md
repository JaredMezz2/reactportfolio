# Personal Portfolio Website developed using React

My portfolio website was long overdue for an update, so what better way than do so while learning a new technology. I have previous experience with React-Native but had yet to touch React, so this was a wonderful introduction to the library and incredibly useful for highlighting the differences between the two. 

Technology Used:
- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
